The article suggests that the goal of software design is to create systems that are as easy to maintain and create for developers as possible, so they can be helpful to users for a long time. Good design skills come from fully understanding the systems and tools you are working with. A key difference between good and bad developers is understanding. Simplicity is key to good software design, and complexity is the source of many software failures. To avoid being a victim of these failures, know your software's purpose, keep your code simple, and resist unnecessary changes.
